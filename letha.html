            <h2>1. Process</h2>
            <p>
              My target audience of choice was men in the ages 20-30. I
              interviewed three friends in this age range, asking "open"
              questions (to not get simple "yes" or "no" answers) and asked them
              to complete simple tasks on three e-commerce sites for footwear.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used the interviewes to make three personas to have a concrete
              target audience in mind while designing the site. I also used the
              information I gathered in my design choices; what the others sites
              did that worked well, and what did not work as well for my target
              audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before coding, I did some quick pencil sketches of the overall
              layout of the site, and then I made wireframes for all the pages
              in Adobe XD for laptop, mobile and tablet.

              <h2>2. Photos</h2>
              <p>
                Through my research I learned that photos made more impact on
                the target audience than graphic elements and illustrations. I
                did my best to find free high resolution photos with the correct
                mood and cohesive style. All photos were collected from
                Unsplash.com.

              <h2>3. Design Principles</h2>
              <p>
                TYPOGRAPHY: I chose the sans serif font Roboto to use on the
                entire site. This is because I found during my market research
                that sans serif fonts are the most common used on these kinds of
                sites, and my users said they liked "a simple font like
                Helvetica" best. I think the font gives the site a clean and
                professional look, as well as the use of different weights
                breaks it up and helps with the typographic hierarchy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Colors: I chose to go for black, white and grey to further play
                on the clean and professional look of the site. This makes the
                images attract the attention of the viewer, which is desireable
                according to my interviews.
